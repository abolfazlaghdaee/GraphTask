# Wiener of Polythiophene 

This repository contains the code for calculating the wiener index of polythiophene, for my first scienctific paper. 
In this paper, I have calculated the wiener index of polythiophene with different length and different number of rings (PTn). 


### How to Run
just run the `wiener.py` file and see the result.
